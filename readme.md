Extracted-DS is a fork of Extracted-RC that contains a reverse-engineered approximation of the Driver Station source code. This is NOT an FTC-endorsed project and is not competition legal. Please use this for reference purposes or off-season projects only. Using this library in a competition could result in disqualifications.

Thank you to NullPointerError and the OpenFTC team, and (obviously) the FTC Software Team for doing an amazing job designing the FIRST software infrastructure!
